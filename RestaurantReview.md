In my zip file, you will find 4 projects:

* RestaurantReview
	Most of the code in this project is auto-generated.
	The one exception to that is the file RestaurantReviewController.Extensions.cs
	I explicitly separated this controller into 2 partial classes to segregate my code.
	Everything in RestaurantReviewController.Extensions.cs was written by me.

* RestaurantReviewBusiness
	All of the code in this project was written by me as well.

* RestaurantReviewData
	This is all entity framework core and it was auto-generated.
